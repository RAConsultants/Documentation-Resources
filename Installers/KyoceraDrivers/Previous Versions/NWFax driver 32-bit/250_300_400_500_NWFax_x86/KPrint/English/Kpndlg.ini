[HELP]
HELP0=For the sender name and sender address, enter the name and e-mail address of the person who will be sending print jobs. E-mail servers often reject e-mail that does not include a sender e-mail address. These are also used for return receipts and cover pages.\n\nTo send e-mail print jobs, the e-mail port must be able to establish a connection with an SMTP mail server. Enter the SMTP server name or IP address. Click the [Test] button if you want to verify connection to the SMTP server.
HELP1=Enter the e-mail address of the printing system that will receive the print jobs. Click the [Search] button to search the network for printing systems with the e-mail printing capability enabled.\n\nThe port name is displayed in the Windows port list.\n\nWhen [Display the print job cover page dialog] is enabled, the cover page configuration dialog is displayed for each print job. Selecting [Generate return receipts] will cause the printing system to send e-mail confirmation for every print job.
HELP2=If the mail server requires SMTP authentication, check [Use SMTP Authentication] and enter an authorized user name and password.\n\nSplitting into multiple e-mails may be necessary on some systems which limit the size of individual e-mails.
